Skin cancer is an alarming disease for mankind. The necessity of early diagnosis 
of skin cancer have been increased because of the rapid growth rate of Melanoma skin cancer, 
its high treatment costs, and death rate. This cancer cells are detected manually and it takes 
time to cure in most of the cases. The diagnostic is a manual process that is time consuming 
as well as expensive. But todayâ€™s world science has become advanced by using machine 
learning and it can be helpful in many ways. Hence, machine learning can make easy for 
detecting cancerous cells and that is why machine learning especially convolutional neural 
network is used to detect cancerous cell more quickly, and efficiently. Neural Network 
algorithm is utilized to detect the both benign and malignant cells. This framework is based 
on learning the images that are captured with dermato-scope device to find out whether it is 
benign or malignant. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network which 
is used in signal and image processing. CNN is chosen because it gives high accuracy in image 
processing.
